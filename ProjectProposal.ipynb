A higher number of people in Geisel when closer to midterms/final weeks (finals probably more). Observation of us UCSD students of seeing a lot of people in the library during this time.

Since this website measured the number of students taking classes at a certain period of time, the data will be fairly accurate. However, there will be a bias towards students who don't attend class.
