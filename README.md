This is your group repository for your final project for COGS108. This repostory is private, including to other students in the class, but visible to all COGS108 instructors.

We have uploaded your Project Proposal here, and will provide comments and feedback on it here, as an issue. In the meantime, you are welcome and encouraged to use this repository to get started working on your project. 

This repository will be frozen on the due date - at 11:59pm on Thursday, March 22nd, 2018.

Make sure you have a notebook called 'FinalProject.ipynb' present in this repository by the due date. 

Your final project will be graded based solely on that project notebook - make sure it has everything included and displayed (with code outputs) to evaluate your project.
